"""Auto-idle USB power saver for the Dymo printer.

Gated by `USB_POWER_SAVE=true`. When enabled, a background thread
checks every minute whether the server has been idle longer than
`USB_POWER_SAVE_IDLE_MINUTES` (default 60). If so, the printer's USB
port is powered off via uhubctl. Manual `/api/power/*` endpoints in
`app.py` stay always-on regardless of this gate — they're inert when
not called, so there's no reason to hide them.

Activity is recorded by `record_activity()` (wired from a Flask
`before_request` hook). On a printer-using request, the hook also
calls `ensure_powered()` so the printer is back on the bus by the
time the handler runs.
