"""Per-port USB power control via uhubctl.

Lets us power off the Dymo printer's USB port when idle so its transformer
isn't running 24/7, and power it back on when the user opens the page.

Requires `uhubctl` on PATH (apt-installed in the Docker image). The hub must
support per-port power switching (ppps) — confirmed for the 2109:3431 USB
2.0 hub on hector.

    pyusb's `usb.backend.libusb1` caches a `_lib_object` at module level

    notices that a USB device disappeared and re-appeared at a new bus
    address — `usb.core.find()` keeps returning the stale list.

    We call this only after `power_on()`, never after `power_off()`.
    Reason: re-creating a libusb context triggers a fresh USB
    enumeration, which the kernel handles by resuming the hub if it
    was auto-suspended. That resume re-energizes any port we just
    powered off, so on hubs with autosuspend enabled (like the
    2109:3431 we use on hector) a refresh after `power_off()` would
    immediately undo the off. After `power_on()` the port is supposed
    to be powered anyway, so the resume is harmless and we get an
    up-to-date device list.
